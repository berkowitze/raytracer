## About

Hobby raytracer started by following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. Meant as a learning tool, not for production use!

## Building

Windows: Use Visual Studio

Mac:

```
make
```

## Using

Mac:

```
make run
make watch
```

The commands will output preview commands you can paste into a new terminal window to get a live-updating preview of the render.
